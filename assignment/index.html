    <li>For some reason, in #6 on the part-supply.js sheet, the embedded if/then/else statement wouldn't
        work unless I used == instead of === when setting supplyChanges[i] equal to 0.  Last assignment
        you said I should use === most of the time. Is there a reason why it only would have worked with
        ==?</li>

    <li>I couldn't figure out how to do the sum in the final stretch goal.  I left the code I tried in
        there to see what I did wrong.  The sum += supplyChanges[i] would just continue adding the
        number to the end of the sum.  Is it considering sum to be an array or something?</li>

  <ol>
    <li>For some reason, in #6 on the part-supply.js sheet, the embedded if/then/else statement wouldn't
        work unless I used == instead of === when setting supplyChanges[i] equal to 0.  Last assignment
        you said I should use === most of the time. Is there a reason why it only would have worked with
        ==?</li>
